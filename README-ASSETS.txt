Update: use /assets for all images.

- All image references switched from `img/` to `assets/`.
- manifest.json icons now point to assets/skf-192.png and assets/skf-512.png.
- Home (index.html) ensures the 5S hero image appears (assets/5S.png).
- Navbar shows a small "Supervisor" badge next to the brand (index).
- style.css includes styles for the badge and hero image.

Place this ZIP content at the project root (alongside your existing /assets folder).
No /img folder is required anymore.
